# SocialNetwork

# Purpose
This is a MongoDB program that allows users to 'express' their thoughts and have other Users react to their thoughts, similar to most social network platforms. Each thought and reaction is time stamped, and the username and email for each user must be unqiue. Thoughts and reactions are limitied to 280 characters or less. 

# Functionality

Users are able to add, update, or delete their 'profile', their thoughts, and their reactions based on specific id's associated to each item (user, thought, reaction). The program is currently back end only, so all routes are tested through Insomnia.
